# Practicum - Around The US.

This is the third project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design from Figma.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- BEM
- CSS Grid and Media Queries
- Javascript (work in progress)

## Plan on improving the project

Right now the web-page only supports two screen resolutions (1280 and 320), adding more resolutions to support more devices is in order next.

More Javascript functionality.
