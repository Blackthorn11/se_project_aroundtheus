# Practicum - Around The US.

This is the third project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design from Figma.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- BEM
- CSS Grid and Media Queries

## Plan on improving the project

Right now the web-page only supports two screen resolutions (1280 and 320), adding more resolutions to support more devices is in order next.
